## üíº Experience

### Graduate Technical Intern @ [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) _(June 2021 - Present)_ <br>
  - **CBV-NLP Tool:** _Technologies used: Python, NLP._
    - An NLP based Tool which identies the tests required based on the Incoming Software Changes

  - **RAS Pre-Silicon Automation Tool:** _Technologies used: Simics, C._
      - This tool aims at doing RAS in pre-silicon stage itself, so that bugs can be found before the silicon comes, thus reduces time, money and efforts.

  - **RAS Knob Validation Tool:** _Technologies used: UEFI, C._
      - This tool aims at checking whether the knobs can effectively handle incorrect values, incorporates validating knobs automatically in a much accurate and faster manner.
